# 06 - Change Management

Ensure every modification is traceable back to approved requests and properly documented.

## Required Deliverables
- `change_log.md` - cumulative record of releases with CR IDs and semantic versions.
- `revision_history.xlsx` - detailed change tracking with approvers and timestamps.
- `continuous_improvement.md` - lessons learned and backlog of process enhancements.
- `Branch_Naming_Convention.md` - optional quick reference for contributors.

## Templates
- `templates/documentation/Change_Management/Change_Log.md`
- `templates/documentation/Change_Management/Revision_History.csv`
- `templates/documentation/Change_Management/Continuous_Improvement.md`
- `templates/documentation/Change_Management/Branch_Naming_Convention.md`

## Tips
- Update the change log whenever a release is promoted; match tags like `v1.2.0`.
- Attach supporting evidence (approvals, CAB minutes) via links to SharePoint.
- Keep Jira/Azure Boards tickets in sync with the entries captured here.
