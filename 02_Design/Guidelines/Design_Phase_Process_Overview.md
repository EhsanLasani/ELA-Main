Design_Phase_Process_Overview.md  # Design Phase – Process Overview & Template Assignment

## Purpose

This document defines the **Design Phase workflow**, assigns templates from `00_Policy/Templates/03_Design/`, and clarifies when/how each template is used. The Design phase translates Definition phase requirements into detailed architecture, API specifications, data models, infrastructure design, and observability requirements.

---

## Design Phase Objectives

The Design Phase establishes **HOW** to build the solution through:
- **Solution Architecture**: System components, interfaces, deployment topology
- **Data Design**: Database schemas, data flows, APIs
- **Infrastructure Design**: Cloud/on-prem resources, networking, scalability
- **Observability Design**: SLIs, SLOs, metrics, logs, traces, dashboards
- **Technology Stack**: Frameworks, languages, tools, standards
- **UX/UI Design**: User flows, wireframes, accessibility standards
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure designs meet compliance matrix from Definition
