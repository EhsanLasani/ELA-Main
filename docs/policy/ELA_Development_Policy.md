# Policy and Procedure: Enterprise-Level Application (ELA) Development Framework

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines the governance, standards, and operating model for designing, developing, testing, and operating Enterprise-Level Applications (ELAs). It ensures:

- Consistent, high-quality delivery across all ELA initiatives.
- Full traceability of activities, decisions, and assets from concept through operations.
- Secure, compliant collaboration using modern IDEs, GitHub, Microsoft Teams, and AI assistants such as ChatGPT Codex.
- Automation of lifecycle controls while maintaining human oversight and accountability.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:

- Every ELA initiative delivered by or on behalf of the organization.
- Internal and outsourced delivery teams (architecture, development, QA, DevOps, PMO, vendors).
- Tooling stacks that include IDEs, AI coding assistants, CI/CD platforms, Microsoft Teams/SharePoint, Git/GitHub, and time-tracking/reporting systems.

## 3. Governance and Ownership
- **Policy Owner:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- **Custodian:** Enterprise Architecture Office (EAO)
- **Compliance Oversight:** IT Governance & PMO
- **Policy Review Cadence:** Annual minimum; interim updates triggered by regulatory change, security advisories, or lessons learned. All revisions must be communicated via the ELA Hub Teams channel and recorded in Appendix D.

## 4. Policy Overview

### 4.1 Project Registration and Workspace Initialization
1. PMO issues a unique project identifier and registers the project in the ELA Portfolio register.
2. Create a private Microsoft Teams channel under the `ELA_Projects_Hub` team using the naming convention `ELA_<ProjectID>_<Name>`. The channel acts as the single collaboration hub for announcements, files, tasks, and automation.
3. Provision a dedicated GitHub repository following the hierarchy in Section 9 and link it to the Teams channel.
4. Initialize the workspace using the baseline from `ELA-Main`:
   - `/01_Definition`
   - `/02_Execution`
   - `/03_Coding`
   - `/04_Testing`
   - `/05_Deployment`
   - `/06_Change_Management`
   - `/07_Monitoring_Control`
   - `.codex/`, `.github/`, and `/docs/` subtrees
5. Seed workspace templates (requirements, test plans, deployment checklists, change logs, AI prompts) from `ELA-Main/templates` using automation (Power Automate or Azure Logic Apps).
6. Document project architecture context and coding standards in `/01_Definition/Project_Plan.md` and `/03_Coding/standards/` before development begins.

### 4.2 Systems Integration Blueprint (Summary)
- **Teams Channel Configuration:** Each private channel uses the default `Posts` and `Files` tabs plus tabs for GitHub, DevOps dashboards, and project wiki/OneNote. Automations post CI/CD events, pull-request status, and time-tracking summaries.
- **Automation:** Provisioning bots create the Teams channel, SharePoint folder structure, GitHub repo, and preload templates. Integrations use scoped service principals and follow the least-privilege model in Section 7.
- **Access Matrix:** Roles and access levels are defined in Appendix C. Quarterly reviews verify membership alignment across Teams, GitHub, and AI credentials.
- **Workflow:** PMO creates channel → automation links GitHub repository → project clones `ELA-Main` baseline → development proceeds with Codex assistance → CI/CD triggers pipeline → notifications post to Teams → metrics feed Power BI dashboards.

## 5. Development Lifecycle

### 5.1 Definition Phase
Objective: Confirm business intent, architecture, and delivery plan.

Mandatory artifacts:
- `/01_Definition/Project_Plan.md`
- `/01_Definition/Architecture_Diagram.drawio`
- `/01_Definition/Requirements_Document.docx`
- `/01_Definition/Risk_Assessment.xlsx`
- `/01_Definition/Stakeholder_Register.md`

### 5.2 Execution Readiness Phase
Objective: Define delivery infrastructure, tooling, and quality approach.

Mandatory artifacts:
- `/02_Execution/Infrastructure_Design.docx`
- `/02_Execution/Technology_Stack.md`
- `/02_Execution/Test_Plan.xlsx`
- `/02_Execution/Deployment_Plan.md`
- `/02_Execution/AI_Context/context.yaml` (references `../ELA-Main/architecture/` and `../ELA-Main/shared-libs/`)
- `/02_Execution/Compliance_Checklist.md` (environment approvals, data classifications, privacy impact assessment)

### 5.3 Coding Standards and Enforcement
Objective: Ensure maintainable, readable, and traceable code.

Requirements:
- Each source file includes a header block covering purpose, author, creation date, current revision, and change history.
- Functions, classes, and complex logic paths include docstrings or inline comments that explain intent and edge cases.
- `CHANGELOG.md` fragments accompany each pull request, capturing ticket/CR IDs.
- Pre-commit hooks and CI jobs enforce:
  - Linting/formatting per language standard (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, clang-format).
  - Presence of file headers and docstrings (custom script located in `ELA-Main/shared-libs/hooks/header-check`).
  - Security and dependency scans (GitHub Dependabot, CodeQL, or approved equivalent).
- Pull-request template requires reviewers to confirm:
  - Header block updated.
  - Tests written/updated.
  - AI-generated code reviewed.

Deliverable root: `/03_Coding/` (synced with GitHub repository). AI prompt library resides in `/03_Coding/AI_Prompts/` with access restricted per Section 7.

### 5.4 Testing Phase
Objective: Validate functionality, performance, and resilience.

Mandatory artifacts:
- `/04_Testing/Test_Strategy.md`
- `/04_Testing/Test_Case_Inventory.xlsx`
- `/04_Testing/Automated_Test_Report.html`
- `/04_Testing/Defect_Log.xlsx`
- `/04_Testing/Performance_Benchmark.md`

CI must publish automated test results and coverage metrics. Manual test evidence is stored in SharePoint and linked in `/04_Testing/Test_Strategy.md`.

### 5.5 CI/CD Pipeline Standards
Objective: Automate build, test, and deployment with controlled gates.

Baseline:
1. **Continuous Integration (develop and feature branches):**
   - Linting, static analysis, and security scans.
   - Unit and integration tests.
   - Build artifacts stored in the approved repository (e.g., Azure Artifacts, AWS CodeArtifact).
2. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (release/main branches):**
   - Deploy to staging environment automatically after CI success.
   - Require approvals from Product Owner and DevOps lead before promoting to production.
   - Implement automated smoke tests and rollback scripts.
   - Record deployment results under `/05_Deployment/deployment_logs/`.

Configuration files live in `.github/workflows/` or the designated pipeline folder. Shared templates are referenced from `ELA-Main/ci-cd-pipeline/`. Secrets are injected using Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager with GitHub OIDC federation—no secrets stored in plaintext files.

Mandatory artifacts:
- `/05_Deployment/ci_cd_pipeline.yml`
- `/05_Deployment/deployment_logs/` (timestamped subfolders with pipeline outputs)
- `/05_Deployment/Release_Readiness_Checklist.md`

### 5.6 Change Management
Objective: Maintain traceability across code, configuration, and documentation.

- Every commit references an approved change request ID in the commit message (format `CR-####: summary`).
- Branch naming follows standards: `feature/CR-####-shortname`, `hotfix/CR-####`, `release/vX.Y.Z`.
- Pull requests must link to the governing ticket (Jira, Azure Boards) via required metadata.
- Update `/06_Change_Management/change_log.md` and `/06_Change_Management/revision_history.xlsx` per release, capturing date, revision number, scope, impacted modules, and approver signatures.
- Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) applied to tags and documented in `change_log.md`.

### 5.7 Monitoring and Control
Objective: Provide transparency into progress, effort, and quality.

- Resource allocation documented in `/07_Monitoring_Control/Resource_Utilization_Report.md`, mapping roles to lifecycle phases.
- Time tracking captured via integrated tools (Planner, Jira, Clockify) and exported weekly.
- KPIs include schedule variance, defect density, AI-assisted contribution rate, deployment frequency, and mean time to recover.
- Power BI dashboard refreshed weekly; PMO reviews trends and escalates deviations >10% from baseline.
- `/07_Monitoring_Control/Performance_Report.xlsx` contains snapshot data aligned with dashboard visuals.

## 6. Integration and Automation Guidelines
1. **AI Integration (ChatGPT Codex):**
   - IDEs configured with organization-issued API credentials stored in Azure Key Vault.
   - `context.yaml` file declares contextual directories (e.g., `../ELA-Main/architecture/`, `../ELA-Main/shared-libs/`, `./01_Definition/`, `./03_Coding/AI_Prompts/`).
   - AI prompts and completions logged to SharePoint (`/03_Coding/AI_Prompts/logs/`) and reviewed quarterly by the EAO.
   - AI-generated code requires human approval before merge.
2. **Git/GitHub Integration:**
   - Repositories structured per Section 9.
   - Workflows trigger Teams notifications via webhooks after pipeline completion, PR creation, and code reviews.
   - Dependabot and CodeQL alerts must be triaged within five business days.
3. **MS Teams Integration:**
   - Teams channel linked to SharePoint document library mirroring the folder structure in this policy.
   - GitHub and pipeline tabs provide real-time status. Bots relay commit summaries, deployment status, and policy reminders.
4. **Automation Platform:**
   - Power Automate/Azure Logic Apps orchestrate project kickoff (channel, repo, SharePoint provisioning) and archival.
   - Automations run under managed identities with least-privilege access.

## 7. Security and Compliance
- Enforce RBAC across Teams, SharePoint, GitHub, and AI services per Appendix C.
- MFA required for all privileged roles.
- Apply OWASP Top 10 and SANS CWE controls; integrate SAST/DAST in CI pipelines.
- Secrets managed via Key Vault/Secrets Manager; no credentials in repositories.
- Quarterly access audits by IT Governance; evidence stored in `/07_Monitoring_Control/Access_Audit_Reports/`.
- AI data (prompts, completions, model outputs) treated as proprietary and stored in encrypted repositories.
- Backups follow enterprise retention policy; verify restore drills annually.

## 8. Documentation and Archival
- On completion, compile all deliverables, approvals, and reports into `/docs/closeout/<ProjectID>/`.
- Archive Git repository (`Archive` flag in GitHub) with final tag and attach release notes.
- Teams channel moved to the “Completed Projects” section; membership revoked except archival custodians.
- Automation flow validates archive completeness (Git tags, SharePoint packages, metrics exports). Results logged in `/07_Monitoring_Control/Archive_Checklist.md`.
- Retention: 7 years unless superseded by regulatory requirements.

## 9. Tooling and Repository Architecture
- **Main Repository (`ELA-Main`):** Maintained by architects. Contains `/architecture/`, `/shared-libs/`, `/templates/`, `/ci-cd-pipeline/`, and policy documentation. Versioned semantically; updates communicated via Appendix D log.
- **Child Repositories (`ELA-Project-*`):** Cloned from `ELA-Main` baseline. Adopt branch model (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`). GitHub Actions integrate with Teams for status updates.
- **Cross-Project Context:** IDE configuration references both local project folders and shared libraries to ensure consistent code generation and reviews.

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- EAO conducts annual policy review plus post-mortems after each major release.
- Improvement items tracked in `/06_Change_Management/continuous_improvement.md` with owner, due date, and status.
- Updates disseminated via Teams announcements and appended to Appendix D.

## 11. Appendices
