# 02 - Execution Readiness

Capture how the solution will be delivered: environments, tooling, AI usage, and compliance checkpoints.

## Required Deliverables
- `Infrastructure_Design.docx` - environment topology, hosting, networking.
- `Technology_Stack.md` - languages, frameworks, IDE settings, shared libraries.
- `Test_Plan.xlsx` - cycles, entry/exit criteria, coverage targets.
- `Deployment_Plan.md` - CI/CD stages, approvals, rollback strategy.
- `AI_Context/context.yaml` - Codex context sources and prompt library links.
- `Compliance_Checklist.md` - data classification, security, privacy approvals.

## Templates
- `templates/documentation/Execution/Infrastructure_Design.md`
- `templates/documentation/Execution/Technology_Stack.md`
- `templates/documentation/Execution/Test_Plan.xlsx` (+ CSV starter)
- `templates/documentation/Execution/Deployment_Plan.md`
- `templates/documentation/Execution/AI_Context/context.yaml`
- `templates/documentation/Execution/Compliance_Checklist.md`

## Tips
- Start from the templates listed above, then export to DOCX/XLSX where required.
- Store secrets in Key Vault/Secrets Manager; reference them rather than checking into Git.
- Sync the approved `context.yaml` with `.codex/` so AI tooling remains aligned.
