# Contribution Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** Phase 2 (Week 3-4)  
**Purpose:** Guide for proposing changes and contributing to ELA project guidelines and templates

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome
- **Template improvements:** Enhance existing templates with better structure or examples
- **New guidelines:** Propose new guides for emerging needs
- **Bug fixes:** Correct errors, broken links, or typos
- **Clarifications:** Improve unclear sections
- **New terms:** Add definitions to Glossary.md
- **Best practices:** Share lessons learned from using these guidelines

## Contribution Standards

### Writing Style
- **Clear and concise:** Use simple language, avoid jargon (or define it)
- **Action-oriented:** Use imperative mood for instructions ("Click the button" not "You should click")
- **Inclusive:** Use gender-neutral language ("they" instead of "he/she")
- **Consistent:** Match the style and tone of existing documents
- **Examples:** Include practical examples where possible

### Formatting Guidelines
- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Headers: Use sentence case ("Threat modeling process" not "Threat Modeling Process")
- Lists: Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered
- Code blocks: Use triple backticks with language identifier (` ```python `)
- Links: Use descriptive link text, not "click here"
- Tables: Align columns for readability in source

### Template Structure
When creating or modifying templates:
- Include version number and last updated date at the top
- Add a "Purpose" section explaining when to use the template
- Use placeholder text in [brackets] for user-customizable sections
- Include inline examples and instructions
- Add a "How to Use" section at the end

### Documentation Principles
1. **Completeness:** Cover all necessary information without overwhelming
2. **Accuracy:** Ensure technical correctness
3. **Maintainability:** Write docs that are easy to update
4. **Accessibility:** Consider readers with varying expertise levels
5. **Traceability:** Link related documents together
