# Guidelines Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive guidelines and templates for the ELA (Enterprise-Level Architecture) project Definition phase.

## Overview

The Guidelines folder provides structured documentation to help teams create consistent, high-quality requirements, threat models, and non-functional requirements (NFRs).

---

## 7-Step Phase Overview

| # | Phase Step | Purpose / Output | Templates |
|---|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 0 | Stakeholder Identification & Scope Definition | Identify key stakeholders, roles, and initial scope for elicitation | Stakeholder_Register_Template, Project_Kickoff_Checklist, Project_Plan_Template |
| 1 | Requirements Elicitation | Collect and refine stakeholder needs | Requirements_Elicitation_Workshop_Agenda, Context_Diagram.drawio, Data_Flow.md, Dependency_Assessment_Template |
| 2 | Business Process & Use Case Modeling | Visualize current and target workflows, interactions | Context_Diagram.drawio, Data_Flow.md, Interface_Catalog, Architecture_Decision_Record_Template |
| 3 | Requirements Documentation (FR/NFR) | Record functional and non-functional requirements formally | Functional_Requirements_SRS_Template, NFR_Specification_Template, Security_Requirements_Template, Compliance_Matrix_ISO_IEEE_OWASP, Data_Classification_Template |
| 4 | Risk & Gap Analysis | Identify project risks, dependencies, and missing coverage | Risk_Assessment_Template.xlsx, Threat_Modeling_Template, Dependency_Assessment_Template |
| 5 | Validation & Sign-off | Review and approve requirements baseline | Requirements_Document_Template, Test_Strategy_Template, Project_Kickoff_Checklist |
| 6 | Traceability & Governance Setup | Establish requirement-to-design/test linkage & governance | Traceability_Matrix_Template, Data_Governance_Template, Architecture_Decision_Record_Template, README |

## Template Usage Guidelines

| Template | Purpose / When to Use | Usage Instructions |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Stakeholder_Register_Template** | Identify project stakeholders and their roles. | Fill during project initiation; include RACI mapping for approvals and communications. |
| **Project_Kickoff_Checklist** | Ensure pre-analysis setup tasks are completed. | Verify Teams channel, repo access, and template folders are ready. |
| **Project_Plan_Template** | Define timeline, resources, and deliverables. | Document high-level plan and dependencies before elicitation begins. |
| **Requirements_Elicitation_Workshop_Agenda** | Plan requirement workshops with stakeholders. | Add topics, questions, and goals; attach workshop notes post-session. |
| **Context_Diagram.drawio / Data_Flow.md** | Capture process and system boundaries. | Update diagrams whenever new data or actors are identified. |
| **Dependency_Assessment_Template** | Identify inter-system dependencies and constraints. | Cross-reference with interface catalog and risk register. |
| **Interface_Catalog** | List all system interfaces. | Capture direction, protocol, and ownership for each interface. |
| **Architecture_Decision_Record_Template** | Record major technical choices. | One ADR per major decision; include rationale and impacted modules. |
| **Test_Strategy_Template** | Define validation and acceptance test approach. | Draft after requirements are documented; reviewed by QA/PO. |

## Folder Conventions
- All files in this folder are **guidelines** and **instructional aids**.
- They are **not signed-off deliverables** but working tools.
- Each analyst must ensure that outputs are moved to `/Validation/` once finalized.

### Core Documents

- **Requirements_Document_Template.md** - Enhanced template for writing functional and non-functional requirements with traceability, acceptance criteria, and compliance mapping
- **Threat_Modeling_Guide.md** - Step-by-step guide for conducting threat modeling using STRIDE methodology
- **NFR_Guidelines.md** - Comprehensive guidelines for defining measurable non-functional requirements with SLIs/SLOs

### Supporting Documentation

- **Glossary.md** - Key terms and definitions used throughout the ELA project
- **Review_Checklist.md** - Quality checklist for reviewing requirements documents and PRs
- **Contribution_Guidelines.md** - How to propose changes and contribute to these templates

## How to Use

1. **Starting a new requirements document?** Use the Requirements_Document_Template.md as your foundation
2. **Planning security analysis?** Follow the Threat_Modeling_Guide.md
3. **Defining performance/reliability goals?** Consult NFR_Guidelines.md
4. **Unclear on terminology?** Reference the Glossary.md
5. **Reviewing a document?** Use the Review_Checklist.md
6. **Want to improve these docs?** See Contribution_Guidelines.md

## Quality Standards

All documents created using these guidelines should:
- Be measurable and testable
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Consider security implications
- Link requirements to risks and mitigations
- Maintain traceability across phases

## Support
