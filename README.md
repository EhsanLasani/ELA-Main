# 🏗️ ELA-Main  
### Enterprise-Level Application Development Framework (Main Repository)

**ELA-Main** is the **master governance and template repository** for all Enterprise-Level Application (ELA) projects.  
It defines the standardized structure, policies, automation pipelines, and AI-assisted development workflows used across the organization.

## 📘 Purpose

The purpose of **ELA-Main** is to:
- Provide a **single source of truth** for enterprise application standards.  
- Maintain reusable **architecture blueprints, CI/CD pipelines, and coding conventions**.  
- Enable AI-assisted development using **ChatGPT Codex** with consistent prompt templates.  
- Ensure full traceability, compliance, and change management for all software projects.  
- Integrate seamlessly with **Microsoft Teams**, **GitHub**, and **CI/CD** systems.

Each new ELA project is created as a **child repository** cloned or templated from ELA-Main.
