# Glossary

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** Phase 2 (Week 3-4)  
**Purpose:** Common terms and definitions used throughout the ELA project

## B

**Backlog**  
A prioritized list of work items (features, bugs, technical debt) waiting to be implemented.

## D

**Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**  
A visual representation showing how data moves through a system, including external entities, processes, data stores, and trust boundaries.

**Definition Phase**  
The first phase of the ELA lifecycle where requirements, threat models, and NFRs are documented before design and implementation.

**DoS (Denial of Service)**  
An attack that makes a system or service unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with traffic or causing it to crash.

## F

**Functional Requirement**  
A requirement that describes what a system should do, typically expressed as user stories or use cases.

## I

**Information Disclosure**  
A security threat where sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties.

**ISO 27001**  
International standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

## N

**NFR (Non-Functional Requirement)**  
A requirement that describes how a system should perform, including performance, security, reliability, maintainability, and usability characteristics.

**NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**  
US government agency that develops standards and guidelines, including the Cybersecurity Framework.

## P

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**  
Information that can be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers.

**Priority**  
The relative importance of a requirement, often categorized as P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low).

## S

**SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**  
Security testing method that analyzes source code for vulnerabilities without executing it.

**DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**  
Security testing method that tests running applications for vulnerabilities.

**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**  
A quantitative measure of some aspect of service level (e.g., request latency, error rate).

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**  
A target value or range for an SLI (e.g., 99.9% uptime, p95 latency < 200ms).

**SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)**  
Auditing standard for service organizations covering security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

**Spoofing**  
A security threat where an attacker impersonates another user, device, or entity.

**STRIDE**  
Threat modeling methodology covering six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.

## U

**Use Case**  
A description of how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal.

**User Story**  
A requirement format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality], so that [business value]."
