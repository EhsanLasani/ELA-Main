# Threat Modeling Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** Phase 2 (Week 3-4)  
**Purpose:** Guide teams through systematic threat identification and mitigation using STRIDE methodology

## 1. Introduction

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, prioritizing, and addressing potential security threats to a system using the STRIDE framework.

### Benefits
- Proactive identification of security risks early in development
- Cost-effective: cheaper to fix vulnerabilities in design than production
- Improves communication between security and development teams
- Creates audit trail for compliance

## 3. STRIDE Methodology Overview

STRIDE is an acronym for six threat categories:

### S - Spoofing Identity
**Definition:** Pretending to be someone or something else  
**Mitigations:** MFA, digital signatures, mutual TLS, certificate pinning

### T - Tampering with Data
**Definition:** Malicious modification of data  
**Mitigations:** Encryption (TLS, at rest), data integrity checks, input validation

### R - Repudiation
**Definition:** Denying an action was performed  
**Mitigations:** Comprehensive logging, digital signatures, immutable audit logs

### I - Information Disclosure
**Definition:** Exposing information to unauthorized parties  
**Mitigations:** Encryption, access controls, secure error handling

### D - Denial of Service
**Definition:** Degrading or denying service availability  
**Mitigations:** Rate limiting, resource quotas, load balancing, auto-scaling

### E - Elevation of Privilege
**Definition:** Gaining unauthorized capabilities  
**Mitigations:** Least privilege principle, RBAC, input validation, security testing

## 5. Example Threat Model

### System: User Authentication Service

#### Identified Threats

| ID | Component | Threat Type | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|----|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| T-001 | Login API | Spoofing | Attacker impersonates user | High | High | Critical | Implement MFA | In Progress |
| T-002 | Password | Info Disclosure | Passwords in plaintext | Critical | Medium | Critical | Use bcrypt hashing | Closed |
| T-003 | Login API | DoS | Brute force attack | Medium | High | High | Rate limiting | Closed |

## Quick Checklist

### Pre-Threat Modeling
- [ ] Identify system scope
- [ ] Assemble cross-functional team
- [ ] Gather architecture diagrams

### During Threat Modeling
- [ ] Create data flow diagram
- [ ] Identify assets and trust boundaries
- [ ] Walk through STRIDE for each component
- [ ] Rate each threat
- [ ] Propose mitigations

### Post-Threat Modeling
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Create security tickets
- [ ] Assign owners and deadlines
- [ ] Update requirements document
- [ ] Set next review date
