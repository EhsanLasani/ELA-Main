# Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Implementation Guidelines

## 0. Metadata

- **Artifact ID (catalog.csv):** DOC-DEF-NFR-GUIDE
- **Version:** v1.0
- **Owner:**
- **Linked Ticket / PR:**

## 1. Understanding NFR Categories

### 1.1 Performance Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Response time targets (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
- Throughput requirements (requests/second, transactions/minute)
- Batch processing time windows
- Resource utilization limits (CPU, memory, I/O)

**Best Practices:**
- Use percentile-based metrics (avoid averages alone)
- Define performance under normal and peak load
- Specify measurement points (client-side, server-side, end-to-end)
- Consider network latency and geographical distribution

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: API response time p95 < 500ms under 1000 req/s load
❌ BAD: System should be fast
```

### 1.2 Availability & Reliability

**What to Define:**
- Uptime targets (SLA: 99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%)
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)

**Best Practices:**
- Define availability windows (24/7 vs business hours)
- Include planned maintenance windows
- Specify redundancy requirements
- Document failover and disaster recovery scenarios

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: 99.95% uptime (21.6 min/month downtime), RTO=15min, RPO=5min
❌ BAD: System should be highly available
```

### 1.3 Scalability Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Current capacity requirements
- Expected growth trajectory (1 year, 3 years, 5 years)
- Scaling triggers and thresholds
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling strategy

**Best Practices:**
- Base on business forecasts and user growth projections
- Define both compute and data scaling needs
- Consider geographic expansion requirements
- Plan for seasonal/event-driven peaks

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: Support 10K concurrent users (Year 1), scaling to 50K (Year 3) with <10s horizontal scaling response
❌ BAD: System should scale as needed
```

### 1.4 Security Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, SAML, MFA)
- Authorization model (RBAC, ABAC)
- Encryption standards (at-rest, in-transit)
- Audit logging requirements
- Compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)

**Best Practices:**
- Reference industry standards (OWASP ASVS 4.0, NIST)
- Define security testing requirements (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
- Specify security event monitoring and alerting
- Document security incident response requirements

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: Implement OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, OWASP ASVS Level 2 compliance
❌ BAD: System should be secure
```

## 3. NFR Prioritization

### Priority Levels

**Critical (P0):**
- Legal/regulatory compliance requirements
- Security requirements protecting sensitive data
- Availability requirements for business-critical functions

**High (P1):**
- Performance requirements affecting user experience
- Scalability requirements for near-term growth
- Maintainability requirements for core components

**Medium (P2):**
- Usability requirements for non-critical features
- Performance optimizations beyond acceptable thresholds
- Scalability requirements for long-term growth

**Low (P3):**
- Nice-to-have usability improvements
- Performance optimizations with marginal benefit
- Advanced monitoring/observability features

### Prioritization Framework

Consider:
1. **Business Impact:** Revenue, customer satisfaction, competitive advantage
2. **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, data loss
3. **Technical Debt:** Long-term maintainability and evolvability
4. **Cost:** Implementation and operational cost vs benefit
5. **Dependencies:** Prerequisites for other requirements

## 5. NFR Testing & Validation

### Performance Testing

**Load Testing:**
- Simulate expected user load
- Validate response times under normal conditions
- Tools: JMeter, Gatling, k6

**Stress Testing:**
- Test system behavior under extreme load
- Identify breaking points and degradation patterns
- Tools: Locust, Artillery

**Soak Testing:**
- Test sustained load over extended periods
- Identify memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Duration: 24-72 hours minimum

### Availability Testing

**Failover Testing:**
- Test automated failover mechanisms
- Measure RTO and validate against targets
- Simulate node failures, network partitions

**Disaster Recovery Testing:**
- Test backup and restore procedures
- Validate RPO and data integrity
- Conduct quarterly DR drills

### Scalability Testing

**Elasticity Testing:**
- Test auto-scaling behavior
- Measure scale-up and scale-down timing
- Validate resource de-provisioning

**Capacity Planning:**
- Establish baseline metrics
- Model future capacity needs
- Identify bottlenecks before production

### Security Testing

**SAST (Static Application Security Testing):**
- Automated code scanning
- Detect security vulnerabilities early
- Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Snyk

**DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):**
- Runtime security testing
- Identify vulnerabilities in deployed applications
- Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

**Penetration Testing:**
- Third-party security assessment
- Frequency: Annual or before major releases
- Scope: External and internal infrastructure

## 7. NFR Governance

### Review Checkpoints

**Definition Phase:**
- NFR completeness review
- Feasibility assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis

**Design Phase:**
- Architecture validation against NFRs
- Technology selection justification
- Proof-of-concept for high-risk NFRs

**Development Phase:**
- Continuous performance testing
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review for performance patterns

**Testing Phase:**
- NFR validation testing
- Load/stress/soak testing
- Security penetration testing

**Production:**
- SLO monitoring and alerting
- Incident response and postmortems
- Continuous optimization

### NFR Change Management

**Process:**
1. Proposed NFR changes require Architecture Review Board (ARB) approval
2. Impact assessment on existing architecture and design
3. Update all related documentation and test plans
4. Communicate changes to stakeholders
5. Update monitoring and alerting thresholds

## 9. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Vague Requirements
**Problem:** "System should be fast"
**Solution:** Define specific, measurable targets with conditions

### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Baseline Metrics
**Problem:** Setting targets without understanding current performance
**Solution:** Establish baseline through benchmarking and profiling

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Ignoring Cost Implications
**Problem:** Defining NFRs without considering infrastructure costs
**Solution:** Conduct cost-benefit analysis for each NFR

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Setting unnecessarily stringent targets
**Solution:** Align NFRs with actual business needs and user expectations

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Testing Too Late
**Problem:** Discovering NFR violations during production
**Solution:** Integrate NFR testing throughout the SDLC
