## Purpose

This guide provides practical implementation guidance for defining, documenting, and validating Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) within the ELA framework. It supplements the NFR_Specification_Template.md and aligns with ELA Development Policy v2.0 Section 4 (Requirements & Architecture).

## 1. Understanding NFR Categories

### 1.1 Performance Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Response time targets (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
- Throughput requirements (requests/second, transactions/minute)
- Batch processing time windows
- Resource utilization limits (CPU, memory, I/O)

**Best Practices:**
- Use percentile-based metrics (avoid averages alone)
- Define performance under normal and peak load
- Specify measurement points (client-side, server-side, end-to-end)
- Consider network latency and geographical distribution

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: API response time p95 < 500ms under 1000 req/s load
❌ BAD: System should be fast
```

### 1.2 Availability & Reliability

**What to Define:**
- Uptime targets (SLA: 99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%)
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)

**Best Practices:**
- Define availability windows (24/7 vs business hours)
- Include planned maintenance windows
- Specify redundancy requirements
- Document failover and disaster recovery scenarios

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: 99.95% uptime (21.6 min/month downtime), RTO=15min, RPO=5min
❌ BAD: System should be highly available
```

### 1.3 Scalability Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Current capacity requirements
- Expected growth trajectory (1 year, 3 years, 5 years)
- Scaling triggers and thresholds
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling strategy

**Best Practices:**
- Base on business forecasts and user growth projections
- Define both compute and data scaling needs
- Consider geographic expansion requirements
- Plan for seasonal/event-driven peaks

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: Support 10K concurrent users (Year 1), scaling to 50K (Year 3) with <10s horizontal scaling response
❌ BAD: System should scale as needed
```

### 1.4 Security Requirements

**What to Define:**
- Authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, SAML, MFA)
- Authorization model (RBAC, ABAC)
- Encryption standards (at-rest, in-transit)
- Audit logging requirements
- Compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)

**Best Practices:**
- Reference industry standards (OWASP ASVS 4.0, NIST)
- Define security testing requirements (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
- Specify security event monitoring and alerting
- Document security incident response requirements

**Example:**
```
✅ GOOD: Implement OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, OWASP ASVS Level 2 compliance
❌ BAD: System should be secure
```

## 2. Defining Measurable NFRs

### SMART Criteria for NFRs

**S - Specific:** Clearly define what will be measured
**M - Measurable:** Include quantifiable metrics
**A - Achievable:** Ensure technical feasibility
**R - Relevant:** Align with business objectives
**T - Time-bound:** Specify measurement windows

### Template for Writing NFRs

```
[NFR-ID] [Category] [Priority]: [System/Component] shall [action/capability] [measurable target] under [conditions] measured by [metric/method].

Example:
NFR-001 Performance Critical: The payment API shall process transactions with p95 response time < 500ms under 1000 req/s load measured via APM tool.
```

## 3. NFR Prioritization

### Priority Levels

**Critical (P0):**
- Legal/regulatory compliance requirements
- Security requirements protecting sensitive data
- Availability requirements for business-critical functions

**High (P1):**
- Performance requirements affecting user experience
- Scalability requirements for near-term growth
- Maintainability requirements for core components

**Medium (P2):**
- Usability requirements for non-critical features
- Performance optimizations beyond acceptable thresholds
- Scalability requirements for long-term growth

**Low (P3):**
- Nice-to-have usability improvements
- Performance optimizations with marginal benefit
- Advanced monitoring/observability features

### Prioritization Framework

Consider:
1. **Business Impact:** Revenue, customer satisfaction, competitive advantage
2. **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, data loss
3. **Technical Debt:** Long-term maintainability and evolvability
4. **Cost:** Implementation and operational cost vs benefit
5. **Dependencies:** Prerequisites for other requirements

## 9. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Vague Requirements
**Problem:** "System should be fast"
**Solution:** Define specific, measurable targets with conditions

### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Baseline Metrics
**Problem:** Setting targets without understanding current performance
**Solution:** Establish baseline through benchmarking and profiling

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Ignoring Cost Implications
**Problem:** Defining NFRs without considering infrastructure costs
**Solution:** Conduct cost-benefit analysis for each NFR

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Setting unnecessarily stringent targets
**Solution:** Align NFRs with actual business needs and user expectations

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Testing Too Late
**Problem:** Discovering NFR violations during production
**Solution:** Integrate NFR testing throughout the SDLC
