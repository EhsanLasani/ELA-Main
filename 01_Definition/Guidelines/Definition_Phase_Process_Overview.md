# Definition Phase - Process Overview & Template Assignment

## Purpose

This document defines the **Definition Phase workflow**, assigns templates from `00_Policy/Templates/02_Definition/`, and clarifies when/how each template is used. The Definition phase establishes **WHAT** needs to be built through requirements, stakeholder analysis, and compliance frameworks.

## Inputs from Previous Phase

| Input Artifact | Source Template (Initiation) | What It Provides |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Strategic Analysis | Strategic_Analysis_Implementation_Plan.md | Business goals, strategic imperatives |
| Business Case | Business_Case_Template.md | Value proposition, ROI justification |
| Stakeholder List | Stakeholder_Analysis_Template.md | Initial stakeholder identification |
| Initial Scope | Project_Charter_Template.md | High-level project boundaries |
| Risk Register | Risk_Assessment.csv | Known risks and constraints |

### **Phase 2: Requirements Engineering**

#### Step 2.1: Functional Requirements Specification
**Template**: Functional_Requirements_SRS_Template.md
- **Inputs**: Business case, user stories, strategic goals
- **Activities**:
  - Gather functional requirements through workshops
  - Document user stories with acceptance criteria
  - Define system behaviors and business rules
  - Establish requirements traceability matrix
- **Outputs**: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- **Owner**: Business Analyst / Product Owner
- **Approver**: Product Owner / Business Sponsor

#### Step 2.2: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
**Template**: Non_Functional_Requirements_Template.md
- **Inputs**: SRS, architectural constraints, compliance needs
- **Activities**:
  - Define performance requirements (response time, throughput)
  - Specify scalability and availability targets
  - Document security and privacy requirements
  - Establish usability and accessibility standards
- **Outputs**: NFR document with measurable SLIs/SLOs
- **Owner**: Solution Architect / Technical Lead
- **Approver**: Enterprise Architecture Review Board (ARB)

#### Step 2.3: Use Case Documentation
**Template**: Use_Case_Template.md
- **Inputs**: Functional requirements, user journey maps
- **Activities**:
  - Document primary and alternative flows
  - Identify actors and their goals
  - Define preconditions and postconditions
  - Map use cases to requirements
- **Outputs**: Use case diagrams and descriptions
- **Owner**: Business Analyst
- **Approver**: Product Owner

#### Step 2.4: User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
**Template**: User_Story_Template.md
- **Inputs**: Functional requirements, use cases
- **Activities**:
  - Write user stories in "As a... I want... So that..." format
  - Define INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
  - Create acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format
  - Prioritize using MoSCoW or WSJF
- **Outputs**: Product backlog with prioritized stories
- **Owner**: Product Owner
- **Approver**: Product Owner / Stakeholders

### **Phase 4: Risk & Threat Analysis**

#### Step 4.1: Risk Assessment
**Template**: Risk_Assessment_Template.md
- **Inputs**: Project scope, stakeholder concerns, historical data
- **Activities**:
  - Identify risks across technical, business, and operational domains
  - Assess probability and impact using risk matrix
  - Define risk appetite and tolerance levels
  - Develop mitigation and contingency plans
- **Outputs**: Risk register with mitigation strategies
- **Owner**: Risk Manager / Project Manager
- **Approver**: Risk Committee / Steering Committee

#### Step 4.2: Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
**Template**: Threat_Modeling_Template.md
- **Inputs**: System context, data flows, trust boundaries
- **Activities**:
  - Create threat model using STRIDE methodology
    - Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
  - Identify assets and attack vectors
  - Assess threat likelihood and impact
  - Define security controls and countermeasures
- **Outputs**: Threat model with mitigation controls
- **Owner**: Security Architect / AppSec Engineer
- **Approver**: CISO

### **Phase 6: Business Process & Change Management**

#### Step 6.1: Business Process Mapping
**Template**: Business_Process_Mapping_Template.md
- **Inputs**: Current state documentation, stakeholder interviews
- **Activities**:
  - Document as-is business processes (BPMN diagrams)
  - Identify pain points and inefficiencies
  - Design to-be processes with system integration
  - Perform gap analysis and impact assessment
- **Outputs**: Business process models (as-is and to-be)
- **Owner**: Business Process Analyst
- **Approver**: Business Unit Leaders

#### Step 6.2: Change Management Plan
**Template**: Change_Management_Plan_Template.md
