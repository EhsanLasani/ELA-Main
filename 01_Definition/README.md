# 01 - Definition

Establish the project foundation before any build work starts. Populate this folder with the artifacts that capture intent, scope, and architecture.

## Required Deliverables
- `Project_Plan.md` - objectives, milestones, budget, governance contacts.
- `Requirements_Document.docx` - approved functional and non-functional requirements.
- `Architecture_Diagram.drawio` - high-level and detailed system views.
- `Risk_Assessment.xlsx` - identified risks with impact/mitigation.
- `Stakeholder_Register.md` - roles, responsibilities, communication cadence.

## Templates
- `templates/documentation/Definition/Project_Plan.md`
- `templates/documentation/Definition/Requirements_Document.md`
- `templates/documentation/Definition/Architecture_Diagram.drawio`
- `templates/documentation/Definition/Risk_Assessment.xlsx` (+ CSV starter)
- `templates/documentation/Definition/Stakeholder_Register.md`

## Tips
- Copy the templates above into this folder and export to DOCX/XLSX as stakeholders require.
- Link supporting SharePoint documents using relative paths or URLs.
- Record assumptions and decisions so downstream teams understand constraints.
