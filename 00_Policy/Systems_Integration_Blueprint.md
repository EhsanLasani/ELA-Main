## Purpose & Scope

This blueprint provides a comprehensive, ELA-compliant, and internationally aligned framework for systems integration in the ELA-Main repository. It is structured to guide integration activities and deliverables for each SDLC phase, referencing the ELA Artifact Metadata Standards, Document Structure Guidelines, and the unified ELA_Development_Systems_Integration_Policy.md.

---

## Phase-by-Phase Integration Guidance

This section maps integration activities, deliverables, and controls to each SDLC phase. All integration work must use ELA-compliant templates (00_Policy/Templates/phasewise), phasewise guides, and store completed artifacts in phasewise Validation folders.

### 1. Planning (Initiation)
**Integration Focus:**
- Identify integration needs, stakeholders, and high-level requirements.
- Document initial integration risks and constraints.
- Plan for integration blueprint creation in later phases.
- **Templates:** Business_Case_Template.md, Project_Charter_Template.md
- **Guides:** 01_Definition/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 01_Definition/Validation/

### 2. Analysis (Definition)
**Integration Focus:**
- Gather and analyze integration requirements and dependencies.
- Perform risk and gap analysis for integration points.
- Establish traceability for integration requirements.
- **Templates:** Requirements_Document.md, Risk_Assessment.csv, Gap_Analysis_Template.md
- **Guides:** 01_Definition/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 01_Definition/Validation/

### 3. Design
**Integration Focus:**
- Create and maintain this Systems Integration Blueprint as the master artifact.
- Develop architecture diagrams (C4, sequence, data flow) and interface definitions for integration.
- Define NFRs (performance, security, scalability) for integration points.
- **Templates:** Architecture_Diagram_Template.md, Systems_Integration_Blueprint.md, NFR_Template.md
- **Guides:** 02_Design/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 02_Design/Validation/

### 4. Implementation (Development)
**Integration Focus:**
- Build and configure integration components per blueprint.
- Update blueprint with technical details, interface contracts, and traceability.
- Conduct code reviews and maintain integration documentation.
- **Templates:** Coding_Standards.md, Integration_Traceability_Matrix.md
- **Guides:** 03_Development/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 03_Development/Validation/

### 5. Testing
**Integration Focus:**
- Validate all integration points (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security).
- Update blueprint with test results and traceability matrix.
- Ensure all integration deliverables meet exit criteria.
- **Templates:** Test_Plan_Template.md, Test_Report_Template.md, Traceability_Matrix.md
- **Guides:** 05_Testing/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 05_Testing/Validation/

### 6. Deployment
**Integration Focus:**
- Finalize and archive integration blueprint with release.
- Ensure all integration deliverables are baselined and accessible.
- Conduct deployment reviews and release communications.
- **Templates:** Deployment_Plan_Template.md, Release_Notes_Template.md
- **Guides:** 06_Deployment/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 06_Deployment/Validation/

### 7. Maintenance (Operations & Change Management)
**Integration Focus:**
- Monitor integration health, respond to incidents, and update blueprint for changes.
- Capture lessons learned and manage integration change requests.
- **Templates:** Runbook_Template.md, Incident_Report_Template.md, Change_Request_Template.md, Lessons_Learned_Template.md
- **Guides:** 07_Operations/Guidelines/, 08_Change_Management/Guidelines/
- **Instances:** 07_Operations/Validation/, 08_Change_Management/Validation/

---

All integration activities must be completed, reviewed, and approved at each phase before proceeding. Use the ELA documentation structure for traceability and compliance.

- **Version:** v2.0
- **Owner:** Enterprise Architecture Office (EAO)
- **Effective Date:** 2025-10-23
- **Review Cycle:** Quarterly
- **Linked Ticket / PR:**

## 1. Provisioning and Workspace Automation

### 1.1 Automated Project Initialization

**Trigger:** New ELA project registration

**Automation Tool:** PowerShell scripts, Azure Logic Apps, or GitHub Actions

**Provisioned Resources:**
- **MS Teams:** Private channel under ELA Hub Team
- **GitHub:** Repository cloned from ELA-Main template with branch protection rules
- **Project Board:** Azure DevOps, Jira, or GitHub Projects with default workflows
- **SharePoint:** Document library linked to Teams channel
- **Environments:** Dev, Test, Staging, Production with appropriate access controls
- **Secrets:** Initial service principals, connection strings stored in Key Vault
- **Monitoring:** Default dashboards and alert rules

**Outputs:**
- Project ID
- Teams channel link
- GitHub repository URL
- Environment URLs
- Initial documentation

### 1.2 Identity and Access Management

**Identity Provider:** Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Okta, or corporate SSO

**Access Control:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Mapped across all platforms
- **Least Privilege:** Users granted minimum required permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Required for all environments
- **Conditional Access:** Based on device compliance, location, risk level

**Service Principals:**
- Managed identities for Azure resources
- Service accounts with rotated secrets for GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines

## 3. Branching Strategy and Release Management

### 3.1 GitFlow or Trunk-Based Development

**GitFlow (recommended for complex projects):**
- `main`: Production releases
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `release/*`: Release candidates
- `hotfix/*`: Production fixes

**Trunk-Based (recommended for high-velocity teams):**
- `main`: Always deployable
- Short-lived feature branches (< 2 days)
- Feature flags for incomplete work

### 3.2 Semantic Versioning and Tagging

**Format:** `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`

Example: v2.1.3

**Changelog:**
- Auto-generated from Conventional Commits
- Published with each release

## 5. Secrets Management and Configuration

### 5.1 Centralized Secrets Vault

**Tools:** Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault

**Integration Points:**
- IDEs: Plugins to fetch secrets locally (never commit)
- CI/CD: Pipelines fetch secrets at runtime
- Applications: Managed identities or service principals retrieve secrets

**Secret Rotation:**
- Automatic rotation schedules (e.g., 90 days)
- Alerts for expiring secrets
- Audit logs for all access

### 5.2 Configuration Management

**Environment-Specific Config:**
- Use configuration files per environment (dev.json, prod.json)
- Never hardcode environment-specific values

**Feature Flags:**
- LaunchDarkly, Azure App Configuration, or custom solution
- Enable/disable features without redeployment

## 7. Observability and Monitoring

### 7.1 Logging, Metrics, Tracing

**Logging:**
- Structured logs (JSON format)
- Centralized aggregation (Azure Log Analytics, ELK, Splunk)
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

**Metrics:**
- Application metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business metrics (transactions, conversions, active users)

**Tracing:**
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, Azure Application Insights)

### 7.2 SLO and Error Budgets

**SLO Examples:**
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Latency: p95 < 200ms
- Error Rate: < 0.1%

**Error Budget:**
- Calculated monthly
- If budget exhausted, halt new features and focus on reliability

### 7.3 Dashboards and Alerts

**Dashboards:**
- Golden signals: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
- Business KPIs
- Infrastructure health

**Alerting:**
- Based on SLO violations
- Tiered escalation: Team → Manager → On-Call
- Runbooks linked to each alert

## 9. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

### 9.1 Backup and Recovery

**Backup Strategy:**
- Database: Daily full backups + hourly incrementals
- Code: Version-controlled in GitHub with off-site replicas
- Configuration: Stored in version control and backed up vaults

**RTO/RPO Targets:**
- Critical systems: RTO < 1 hour, RPO < 15 minutes
- Standard systems: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour

### 9.2 Runbooks and Playbooks

**Incident Response:**
- Detection → Triage → Mitigation → Resolution → Post-Mortem

**Runbook Contents:**
- Service description
- Common issues and fixes
- Escalation contacts
- Rollback procedures

**DR Drills:**
- Conduct at least annually
- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks based on findings
