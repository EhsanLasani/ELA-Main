## 1. Purpose & Scope

This unified policy defines the mandatory standards, practices, and controls for all ELA projects and derivative repositories, including systems integration requirements. It is aligned with international SDLC standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, CMMI, PMBOK) and ensures quality, security, compliance, and continuous improvement across all phases and teams.

**Scope:**
- All ELA projects and derivative repositories
- All contributors: internal teams, external contractors, and AI assistants
- All tools and platforms: IDEs, GitHub, MS Teams, SharePoint, CI/CD systems, monitoring platforms
- All environments: Local development, CI/CD, Dev, Test, Staging, Production
- All SDLC phases: Initiation, Definition, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Operations, Change Management

---

## 2. ELA Documentation Principles

To ensure clarity, traceability, and compliance, the following principles apply:
- **Templates:** Master templates are stored in `00_Policy/Templates/phasewise/` (authoritative, phase-specific).
- **Guides:** Each phase contains a `/Guidelines/` folder with guidance on template use and best practices.
- **Instances:** Each phase contains a `/Validation/` folder for filled templates and deliverables as evidence of compliance.

---



## 3. SDLC Phases: Actionable Execution Guidance

For each SDLC phase, follow the detailed process/steps below. Each step lists the controlling template(s) and references international standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, CMMI, PMBOK) and industry best practices. All activities must use ELA-compliant templates (00_Policy/Templates/phasewise), phasewise guides, and store completed artifacts in phasewise Validation folders.

### 3.1 Planning (Initiation)
**Purpose:** Define business need, objectives, feasibility, and initial scope.

---

All phases must use ELA-compliant templates, guides, and validation artifacts as described above. Each phase must be completed, reviewed, and approved before proceeding to the next.

---

## 4. Policy Controls & Governance

- All SDLC phases must be followed in sequence, with phase gate reviews and required approvals.
- Artifacts must be versioned, reviewed, and stored in the correct phase folder.
- Compliance is enforced via branch protections, CI/CD gates, and audit trails.
- Exceptions require written justification, risk assessment, and CTO approval.
- Policy is reviewed semi-annually and updated as needed.

---

## 5. Systems Integration Blueprint Requirements

Every ELA project must include and maintain a **Systems Integration Blueprint**:
- `Systems_Integration_Blueprint.md` (textual)
- `Systems_Integration_Blueprint.png` (visual)
- `.codex/blueprint-generator.md` (automation context)

**Process Integration:**
1. Project Registration: Repo bootstrapped from ELA-Main includes all blueprint artifacts.
2. Code Reviews: Any integration change requires blueprint update in the same PR.
3. CI Gate: Job `blueprint-guard` validates presence and freshness (updated within last 30 days or since last release).
4. Archival: Freeze and tag blueprint with each production release.

**Phase Mapping:**
- Design: Initial blueprint creation and review
- Development: Blueprint updated with implementation details
- Testing: Integration points validated and documented
- Deployment: Blueprint finalized and archived
- Operations: Blueprint referenced for support and incident response

**Roles & Responsibilities:**
- Architect: Owns blueprint accuracy and updates
- DevOps: Maintains CI gate and diagram generation
- Developers: Keep Codex context aligned to ELA-Main/shared-libs
- PMO: Audits compliance before stage/production gates
