# Design Phase Templates

## Overview
This folder contains master templates for the Design Phase (02_Design) of the ELA-Main governance framework.

## Purpose
The Design Phase establishes **HOW** to build the solution through architecture, UI/UX design, and data modeling.

## Templates Included

### Architecture Templates
- System_Architecture_Template.md
- Component_Design_Template.md
- Interface_Design_Template.md

### UI/UX Templates
- UI_Design_Specifications_Template.md
- UX_Wireframes_Template.md
- User_Flow_Diagram_Template.md

### Data Templates
- Database_Schema_Template.md
- Data_Model_Template.md
- API_Design_Template.md

## Usage
These are **master templates** - the single source of truth.

### How to Use:
1. **DO NOT edit these master templates directly**
2. Reference these templates from `02_Design/Guidelines/`
3. Copy templates to `02_Design/Validation/` for actual project use
4. Follow instructions in `02_Design/Guidelines/` for proper usage

## Template Principle
```
TEMPLATES (00_Policy/Templates) → GUIDELINES (Phase/Guidelines/) → VALIDATION (Phase/Validation/)
Master Copies → Usage Instructions → Filled Instances
```
