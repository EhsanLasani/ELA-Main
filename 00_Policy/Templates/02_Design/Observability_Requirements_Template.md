## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Define comprehensive observability requirements for monitoring system health, performance, and reliability.

### 1.2 Observability Pillars
- **Metrics:** Quantitative measurements
- **Logs:** Discrete events and records
- **Traces:** Request flow through systems

## 2. Metrics Requirements

### 2.1 Application Metrics
- [ ] Request rate (requests/sec)
- [ ] Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Error rate by type
- [ ] Throughput measurements
- [ ] Concurrent connections
- [ ] Business transaction metrics

### 2.2 Infrastructure Metrics
- [ ] CPU utilization
- [ ] Memory utilization
- [ ] Disk I/O and space
- [ ] Network I/O
- [ ] Container metrics
- [ ] Database performance

### 2.3 Collection Standards
| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Interval | 15-60 seconds |
| Retention | 90 days minimum |
| Cardinality | Max 10k series |
| Naming | [namespace]_[metric]_[unit] |

## 3. Logging Requirements

### 3.1 Log Levels
- [ ] ERROR: Application errors
- [ ] WARN: Warning conditions
- [ ] INFO: General information
- [ ] DEBUG: Diagnostic details

### 3.2 Required Fields
- [ ] Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- [ ] Log level
- [ ] Service name
- [ ] Correlation ID
- [ ] User ID (if applicable)
- [ ] Error details

### 3.3 Log Management
- [ ] Centralized aggregation
- [ ] 90-day retention
- [ ] PII masking
- [ ] Search capabilities

## 4. Distributed Tracing

### 4.1 Trace Requirements
- [ ] End-to-end request tracing
- [ ] Span generation per service
- [ ] Parent-child relationships
- [ ] Timing data capture
- [ ] Error capture

### 4.2 Sampling Strategy
- [ ] 100% for errors
- [ ] Adaptive for normal traffic
- [ ] Critical path always traced

## 5. Alerting Requirements

### 5.1 Alert Severity
| Priority | Condition | Response Time |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| P1 - Critical | Service down | Immediate |
| P2 - High | Degraded perf | 15 minutes |
| P3 - Medium | Minor issues | 1 hour |

### 5.2 Alert Channels
- [ ] PagerDuty (critical)
- [ ] Slack (all alerts)
- [ ] Email (non-critical)

## 6. Dashboards

### 6.1 Required Dashboards
- [ ] Executive overview
- [ ] Operations dashboard
- [ ] Service-specific
- [ ] Infrastructure

### 6.2 Dashboard Standards
- [ ] Clear hierarchy
- [ ] Consistent colors
- [ ] Time range selectors
- [ ] Drill-down capability

## 7. Service Level Objectives

### 7.1 Availability SLO
- [ ] Target: 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Error budget: 43 min/month

### 7.2 Performance SLO
- [ ] Latency p95: < 500ms
- [ ] Latency p99: < 1000ms

## 8. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Application instrumented
- [ ] Monitoring agents deployed
- [ ] Log shippers configured
- [ ] Dashboards created
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation complete

## 9. Approval
