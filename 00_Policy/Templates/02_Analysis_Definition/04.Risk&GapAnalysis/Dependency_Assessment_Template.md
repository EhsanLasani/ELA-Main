## How to Use This Template
- Use this template to assess and document all critical dependencies for your project.
- Complete all sections for each dependency. Update as dependencies or risks change.
- Attach supporting evidence and reference related documentation.

---

## 1. Dependency Overview
**Instructions:**
- Summarize the dependency, its purpose, and its business criticality.

### 1.1 Dependency Information
**Dependency Name:** [e.g., ReactJS]
**Version:** [e.g., 18.2.0]
**Type:** [Library/Framework/Service/API]
**License:** [MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.]
**Vendor/Maintainer:** [e.g., Meta]

### 1.2 Purpose & Usage
**Primary Use Case:** [e.g., Frontend UI framework]
**Integration Points:** [e.g., Used in all web modules]
**Business Criticality:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

---

## 2. Assessment Criteria
**Instructions:**
- Evaluate the dependency using the following criteria. Check all that apply and provide evidence where possible.

### 2.1 Technical Evaluation
- [ ] Actively maintained
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Compatible with tech stack
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation quality
- [ ] Community support

### 2.2 Security Assessment
- [ ] No known critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security audit performed
- [ ] Secure by default configuration
- [ ] Supports encryption
- [ ] Regular CVE monitoring
- [ ] Vendor security track record

### 2.3 Legal & Licensing
- [ ] License compatible with usage
- [ ] Commercial use permitted
- [ ] No viral license concerns
- [ ] Attribution requirements met
- [ ] Legal review completed

### 2.4 Operational Considerations
- [ ] Monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Logging support
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Scalability tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Vendor SLA available

---

## 3. Risk Assessment
**Instructions:**
- Identify and document all risks associated with this dependency. Define mitigation strategies for each.

### 3.1 Identified Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Dependency is no longer maintained | High | Medium | Identify alternatives, monitor repo activity |
| Security vulnerability discovered | High | Low | Patch promptly, monitor CVEs |
| Vendor lock-in | Medium | Medium | Document migration path |
| [Add more] | | | |

### 3.2 Vendor Risk
- [ ] Vendor stability assessed
- [ ] Alternative vendors identified
- [ ] Migration path documented
- [ ] Lock-in risk evaluated

---

## 4. Alternatives Considered
**Instructions:**
- List and compare alternative dependencies. Document pros, cons, and decision rationale.

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| Option 1: Angular | Strong community, Google support | Steeper learning curve | Rejected |
| Option 2: Vue.js | Lightweight, easy to learn | Smaller ecosystem | Chosen |
| [Add more] | | | |

---

## 5. Implementation Plan
**Instructions:**
- Define the steps for integrating and maintaining the dependency.

### 5.1 Integration Steps
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Configuration documented
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Rollout plan created
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

### 5.2 Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Alerts set up
- [ ] Update schedule defined
- [ ] Security scanning automated

## 6. Approval
| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Architect | [Name] | [Signature] | [Date] |
| Security Lead | [Name] | [Signature] | [Date] |

## Best Practices
- Assess all critical dependencies before adoption.
- Involve architecture, security, and legal teams in the review process.
- Document all risks and mitigation strategies.
- Review and update dependency assessments regularly.
- Use this template as a living document for ongoing risk management.
