### 9.4 CI/CD Pipeline

```
Code Commit ─> Build ─> Test ─> Security Scan ─> Deploy to Staging ─> E2E Tests ─> Deploy to Production
```

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Source control trigger (Git push)
2. Build application and Docker images
3. Run unit and integration tests
4. Security and vulnerability scanning
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Run E2E and smoke tests
7. Manual approval gate
8. Deploy to production (blue-green)
9. Health check and rollback if needed

### Example Risk Register
| Risk ID   | Description                        | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|
