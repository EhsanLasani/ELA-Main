## How to Use This Template
- Use this template to define observability requirements for your system or project.
- Complete each section with actionable, measurable requirements and link to supporting documentation.
- Review and update requirements as the system evolves.

---


## 1. Overview
Define comprehensive observability requirements for monitoring system health, performance, and reliability. Address metrics, logs, traces, alerting, dashboards, and SLOs.

### Observability Pillars
- **Metrics:** Quantitative measurements
- **Logs:** Discrete events and records
- **Traces:** Request flow through systems


## 2. Metrics Requirements
Define application and infrastructure metrics to be collected, including collection standards.

### Application Metrics
- [ ] Request rate (requests/sec)
- [ ] Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Error rate by type
- [ ] Throughput measurements
- [ ] Concurrent connections
- [ ] Business transaction metrics

### Infrastructure Metrics
- [ ] CPU utilization
- [ ] Memory utilization
- [ ] Disk I/O and space
- [ ] Network I/O
- [ ] Container metrics
- [ ] Database performance

### Collection Standards
| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Interval    | 15-60 seconds |
| Retention   | 90 days min   |
| Cardinality | Max 10k series|
| Naming      | [namespace]_[metric]_[unit] |


## 3. Logging Requirements
Define log levels, required fields, and log management practices.

### Log Levels
- [ ] ERROR: Application errors
- [ ] WARN: Warning conditions
- [ ] INFO: General information
- [ ] DEBUG: Diagnostic details

### Required Fields
- [ ] Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- [ ] Log level
- [ ] Service name
- [ ] Correlation ID
- [ ] User ID (if applicable)
- [ ] Error details

### Log Management
- [ ] Centralized aggregation
- [ ] 90-day retention
- [ ] PII masking
- [ ] Search capabilities


## 4. Distributed Tracing
Define requirements for distributed tracing, including trace requirements and sampling strategy.

### Trace Requirements
- [ ] End-to-end request tracing
- [ ] Span generation per service
- [ ] Parent-child relationships
- [ ] Timing data capture
- [ ] Error capture

### Sampling Strategy
- [ ] 100% for errors
- [ ] Adaptive for normal traffic
- [ ] Critical path always traced


## 5. Alerting Requirements
Define alert severity, response times, and alert channels.

### Alert Severity
| Priority        | Condition        | Response Time |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| P1 - Critical   | Service down     | Immediate     |
| P2 - High       | Degraded perf    | 15 minutes    |
| P3 - Medium     | Minor issues     | 1 hour        |

### Alert Channels
- [ ] PagerDuty (critical)
- [ ] Slack (all alerts)
- [ ] Email (non-critical)


## 6. Dashboards
Define required dashboards and dashboard standards.

### Required Dashboards
- [ ] Executive overview
- [ ] Operations dashboard
- [ ] Service-specific
- [ ] Infrastructure

### Dashboard Standards
- [ ] Clear hierarchy
- [ ] Consistent colors
- [ ] Time range selectors
- [ ] Drill-down capability


## 7. Service Level Objectives
Define SLOs for availability and performance.

### Availability SLO
- [ ] Target: 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Error budget: 43 min/month

### Performance SLO
- [ ] Latency p95: < 500ms
- [ ] Latency p99: < 1000ms


## 8. Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Application instrumented
- [ ] Monitoring agents deployed
- [ ] Log shippers configured
- [ ] Dashboards created
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation complete


## 9. Approval
| Role           | Name     | Signature   | Date  |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Platform Lead  | [Name]   | [Signature] | [Date]|
| SRE Lead       | [Name]   | [Signature] | [Date]|
