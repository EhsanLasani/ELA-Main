## Purpose & Scope

This template provides a comprehensive, ELA-compliant structure for tracking, managing, and resolving technical debt across code, architecture, infrastructure, documentation, and testing. It ensures visibility, prioritization, and continuous improvement, supporting sustainable delivery and risk management.

**Best Practices:**
- Regularly review and update the register as part of sprint or release cycles.
- Assign clear owners and due dates for each debt item.
- Use prioritization criteria to focus on high-impact debt.
- Communicate status and progress to all stakeholders.
