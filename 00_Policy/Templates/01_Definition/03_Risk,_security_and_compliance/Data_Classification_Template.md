## How to Use This Template
- Use this template to classify, govern, and protect all data assets in your project.
- Complete all sections and update as data types, regulations, or business needs change.
- Attach supporting evidence for each classification and control.

---

## 1. Data Inventory & Classification
**Instructions:**
- List all data assets, their classification, type, sensitivity, and applicable regulations.
- Assign data stewards and define retention periods.

| Data Asset | Classification | Type | Sensitivity | Regulation | Source/System | Data Steward | Retention | Access Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------|-------------|------------|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| User Email | Restricted | String | PII | GDPR Art. 5 | User Registration | Data Steward | 7 years post-closure | Role: User Admin |
| User Password Hash | Restricted | String | Auth | NIST 800-63B | Auth Service | Security Office | Account lifetime | System only |
| User Name | Confidential | String | PII | GDPR Art. 5 | User Profile | Data Steward | 7 years | Role: Support, Admin |
| Session Logs | Internal | JSON | No | None | App Server | DevOps | 90 days | Role: DevOps, Support |
| Payment Card (tokenized) | Restricted | Token | Payment | PCI-DSS | Payment Gateway | Finance IT | 3 years | System only |
| [Add more] | | | | | | | | |

---

## 2. Classification Levels & Controls
**Instructions:**
- Define all classification levels and required controls for each.

| Level | Description | Example Data | Required Controls |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Public | Information freely shareable with the public | Marketing materials, public docs | None required |
| Internal | Company confidential, internal use only | Internal communications, project plans | Access control |
| Confidential | Business-critical, limited distribution | Customer data, financial records | Encryption, audit logging, RBAC |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive, strict need-to-know | PII, PHI, payment data, credentials | Strong encryption (AES-256), MFA, strict RBAC, audit trails, DLP |

---

## 3. Data Flow & Processing Map
**Instructions:**
- Map how data moves through the system, including sources, processing, storage, and consumers.

| Data Asset | Source | Processing | Storage | Consumers | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| User Email | Registration API | Validation, normalization | PostgreSQL: users.email | Auth Service, Notification Service | Real-time |
| Order Total | Order API | Currency conversion, tax calc | PostgreSQL: orders.total | Billing, Analytics | Real-time |
| [Add more] | | | | | |

---

## 4. Retention, Deletion & Compliance
**Instructions:**
- Define retention periods, deletion workflows, and compliance requirements for each data type.

| Data Asset | Retention | Regulation/Reason | Deletion Method | Audit/Validation |
|------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| User PII | 7 years post-account closure | GDPR, legal requirements | Automated deletion job | Monthly audit report |
| Financial Transactions | 10 years | Tax regulations, auditing | Automated archival â†’ cold storage | Annual audit |
| Application Logs | 90 days (non-prod), 1 year (prod) | Troubleshooting, security | Automated log rotation | Dashboard monitoring |
| [Add more] | | | | |

### 4.2 Right to Deletion (GDPR/CCPA)
- [ ] User deletion workflow implemented

## Best Practices
- Review and update this plan regularly as data assets or regulations change.
- Engage data stewards and compliance officers in all classification and governance activities.
- Document all decisions and attach supporting evidence for audits.
- Use this template as a living document for ongoing compliance and risk management.
- [ ] Deletion cascades to all systems
- [ ] Verification report generated
- [ ] 30-day completion SLA
- [ ] Legal hold check before deletion
