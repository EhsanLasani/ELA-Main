# Risk Assessment Template (ELA Standard)
# Guidance: Each row represents a risk. Fill in all columns. Use clear, actionable descriptions and mitigation steps. Review and update regularly.
# Best Practices:
# - Use consistent risk IDs (e.g., R-001, R-002)
# - Describe risks specifically (e.g., "Unauthorized access to customer data")
# - Assign realistic probability and impact (Low/Medium/High)
# - Define clear, actionable mitigation steps
# - Assign an accountable owner for each risk
# - Track status (Open, In Progress, Mitigated, Accepted)
# - Review and update risks at each project milestone
