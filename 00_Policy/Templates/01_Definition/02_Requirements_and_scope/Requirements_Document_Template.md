### Appendix H: Best Practices & Usage Notes

**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Start with Context:** Complete Section 1 (Introduction & Context) first to establish project foundation
2. **Identify Stakeholders:** Use Section 2 to identify all stakeholders and their requirements
3. **Document Requirements:** Capture functional (Section 3) and non-functional (Section 4) requirements
4. **Address Data & Integration:** Complete Section 5 for all data and integration needs
5. **Ensure Security & Compliance:** Document security and compliance requirements in Section 6
6. **Document Constraints:** Capture all assumptions, dependencies, and constraints in Section 7
7. **Define Success:** Clearly define acceptance criteria in Section 8
8. **Maintain Traceability:** Use Appendix B to track requirements through to implementation

**Best Practices:**

- **Be Specific:** Requirements should be clear, concise, and testable
- **Use SMART Criteria:** Requirements should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Maintain Traceability:** Link requirements to business objectives and test cases
- **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Use MoSCoW or other frameworks to prioritize effectively
- **Version Control:** Track all changes to requirements with proper version control
- **Review Regularly:** Conduct regular requirements reviews with stakeholders
- **Keep it Updated:** Requirements documents are living documents - update as needed
- **Cross-Reference:** Link to detailed specifications where appropriate

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Vague or ambiguous requirements
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Failure to prioritize requirements
- Not involving stakeholders early and often
- Scope creep without formal change control
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Missing dependencies and constraints
- Inadequate security and compliance considerations
