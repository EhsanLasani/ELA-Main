## Purpose & Scope

This template provides a structured, ELA-compliant format for conducting effective retrospectives at the end of a sprint, release, or project phase.

**Best Practices:**
- Schedule retrospectives at regular intervals (e.g., end of each sprint).
- Foster a safe, blame-free environment for open discussion.
- Focus on actionable improvements, not just observations.
