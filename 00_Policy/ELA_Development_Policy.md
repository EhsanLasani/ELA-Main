## 1. Purpose & Scope

This unified policy defines mandatory standards, practices, and controls for all ELA projects and derivative repositories, including systems integration requirements. It aligns with international SDLC and governance standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, ISO 27001, CMMI, PMBOK, TOGAF, OWASP ASVS 4.0, WCAG 2.2 AA).

**Scope:**
- All ELA projects and derivative repositories
- All contributors: internal teams, external contractors, and AI assistants
- All tools and platforms: IDEs, GitHub, MS Teams, SharePoint, CI/CD systems, monitoring platforms
- All environments: Local, Dev, Test, Staging, Production
- All SDLC phases: Initiation â†’ Change Management

---

## 2. ELA Documentation Principles

- **Templates:** Authoritative versions in `00_Policy/Templates/phasewise/`
- **Guidelines:** `/Guidelines/` folders per phase define best practices
- **Validation:** `/Validation/` folders contain approved evidence
- **Traceability:** Every artifact must be versioned, reviewed, and linked to work items or change tickets.

---

## 3. SDLC Phases: Actionable Execution Guidance

All phases must use ELA-compliant templates, guides, and validation artifacts as described below. Each phase must be completed, reviewed, and approved before proceeding to the next.

## 9. Systems Integration Blueprint Requirements

Every ELA project must include and maintain a **Systems Integration Blueprint** consisting of:
- `Systems_Integration_Blueprint.md` (textual)
- `Systems_Integration_Blueprint.png` (visual)
- `.codex/blueprint-generator.md` (automation context)

**Process Integration:**
1. **Project Registration:** Repo bootstrapped from ELA-Main includes all blueprint artifacts.
2. **Code Reviews:** Any integration change requires blueprint update in the same PR.
3. **CI Gate:** Job `blueprint-guard` validates presence and freshness (updated within last 30 days or since last release).
4. **Archival:** Freeze and tag blueprint with each production release.

**Phase Mapping:**
- **Design:** Initial blueprint creation and review
- **Development:** Blueprint updated with implementation details
- **Testing:** Integration points validated and documented
- **Deployment:** Blueprint finalized and archived
- **Operations:** Blueprint referenced for support and incident response

**Roles & Responsibilities:**
- **Architect:** Owns blueprint accuracy and updates
- **DevOps:** Maintains CI gate and diagram generation
- **Developers:** Keep Codex context aligned to ELA-Main/shared-libs
- **PMO:** Audits compliance before stage/production gates

---

## 10. Observability & Reliability Observability & Reliability

- Implement OpenTelemetry for logging, metrics, and tracing
- Track golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- Maintain dashboards and error budgets as code
- Define RTO/RPO for DR and test annually
- Auto-rollback upon SLO violation

---

## 11. AI Usage & Ethics

- All AI-assisted outputs must be human-reviewed
- No proprietary data used for AI model training
- AI/ML models must include explainability, bias detection, and periodic audits

---

## 12. Technical Debt & Innovation

- Maintain a **technical debt register** with impact and resolution targets
- Reserve **10â€“20% sprint capacity** for remediation
- Encourage innovation via **RFC-driven pilots** with timeboxed evaluation

## 16. Framework Usage for Project Creation and Documentation

### 16.1 Project Initialization
- **Start from ELA-Main** (GitHub: Use this template) or run the initializer script.
- **Initializer Script (PowerShell):** `Tools/Scripts/Initialize-ELAProject.ps1`
  - Example: `./Initialize-ELAProject.ps1 -ProjectPath "." -ProjectName "MyELAProject"`
  - Creates standard folders: `00_Policy, 01_Definition, 02_Design, 03_Development, 04_Systems_Integration, 05_Testing, 06_Deployment, 07_Operations, 08_Change_Management`, plus `Tools/` and `Reports/`, and seeds `Catalogue.csv` and `README.md`.
- **Provisioning (Automated where enabled):** Teams channel, SharePoint library, repo protections, secrets, envs, and dashboards.

### 16.2 Documentation Flow (Per Phase)
For each SDLC phase, copy the **master template** from `00_Policy/Templates/phasewise/[Phase]/` into the project phase folder and fill it. Store approvals/evidence under `[Phase]/Validation/`.

| Phase | Mandatory Artifacts (examples) | Where to store |
|------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| Definition | Business Case, Requirements, Risk Assessment, Stakeholder Register | `/01_Definition/Validation/` |
| Design | Architecture Diagram, **Systems Integration Blueprint**, NFRs, Interface Contracts | `/02_Design/Validation/` |
| Development | Integration Traceability Matrix, Code Review Checklist, README | `/03_Development/Validation/` |
| Testing | Test Plan, NFR Validation, Test Reports | `/05_Testing/Validation/` |
| Deployment | Deployment & Rollback Plans, Release Notes, Approval Form | `/06_Deployment/Validation/` |
| Operations/Change | Runbook, Incident Reports, Change Requests, Lessons Learned | `/07_Operations/Validation/`, `/08_Change_Management/Validation/` |

### 16.3 Automation & Gates
- **`blueprint-guard`** (CI): verifies presence/freshness of Systems Integration Blueprint.
- **NFR Gate**: validates performance, security, accessibility targets before promotion.
- **Audit Export**: compiles compliance evidence (logs, approvals, test artifacts, release notes).

### 16.4 Documentation Lifecycle & Archival
- Each artifact includes metadata (Author, Version, Date, Work Item/CR link).
- Once validated, move to phase **`/Validation/`** (treated as immutable for that phase).
- Closeout: tag repo, archive docs under `/docs/closeout/<ProjectID>/`, export compliance report.

### 16.5 Roles
- **EAO:** architecture/design approvals; **PMO:** phase exit checks; **DevOps:** CI gates; **Teams:** author artifacts and evidence.
