### 4.3 Architecture Standards

**4.3.1 Design Principles**

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Organize code around business domains with clear bounded contexts
2. **API-First:** Design and document APIs before implementation; maintain OpenAPI/Swagger specs
3. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use asynchronous messaging for cross-domain integration
4. **Modularity:** Design for loose coupling and high cohesion
5. **Cloud-Native Patterns:** Apply 12-factor app principles; design for failure
6. **Zero Trust Security:** Never trust, always verify; authenticate every request

**4.3.2 Architecture Documentation**

**Required Artifacts:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): Document significant design decisions
- C4 Model Diagrams: Context, Container, Component, Code diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams: For critical workflows and integrations
- Data Flow Diagrams: Showing data lineage and transformation
- Deployment Architecture: Infrastructure topology

**Standards:**
- Use TOGAF and ArchiMate conventions
- Store diagrams as code (Mermaid, PlantUML, Structurizr DSL)
- Update diagrams with architectural changes
- Review architecture with EAO during Design Phase

### 4.4 Secure-by-Design

**4.4.1 Threat Modeling**
- Mandatory for each new feature, epic, or subsystem
- Use STRIDE or PASTA methodology
- Document threats, mitigations, and residual risks
- Review annually or when architecture changes

**4.4.2 Secure Coding Standards**

- Implement input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Never concatenate user input in queries

**4.4.3 Secrets Management**
- Never store secrets in code, config files, or plain text environment variables
- Use centralized secrets management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate secrets automatically
- Audit secret access and changes

**4.4.4 Encryption**
- **Data in Transit:** TLS 1.2 or higher for all network communication

| **Public** | Freely shareable | Marketing materials | None required |
| **Internal** | Company confidential | Internal communications | Access control |
| **Confidential** | Business-critical | Customer data, financial records | Encryption, audit logging |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive | PII, PHI, payment data, credentials | Strong encryption, MFA, strict access |

**4.5.2 Data Lineage and Cataloging**

- Alert on anomalies and implement remediation

### 4.6 Development Practices

**4.6.1 Code Standards**

File headers must include:
- File name, Purpose, Author/Team, Created date, Last Modified date, Version, License

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use clear, descriptive names following language-specific conventions
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized

**Comments and Documentation:**
- Write self-documenting code; explain "why", not "what"
- Document public APIs and complex algorithms
- Maintain README files

**4.6.2 Version Control and Branching**

**Branching Strategy:** GitFlow or Trunk-Based Development
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes

**Pull Request Requirements:**
- At least one reviewer approval (two for critical code)
- All CI checks must pass
- Code coverage meets threshold
- No unresolved high/critical vulnerabilities
- Link to work item/ticket
- CODEOWNERS approval

**Commit Standards:** Follow Conventional Commits
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, ci, perf

**4.6.3 Testing Standards**

| Test Type | Min Coverage | Automation | Gating |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **Unit Tests** | 80% overall, 100% critical | Yes | Must pass before merge |
| **Integration Tests** | Key workflows, API contracts | Yes | Must pass before Test env |
| **Contract Tests** | All service interfaces | Yes | Must pass before deployment |
| **E2E Tests** | Critical user journeys | Yes | Must pass before Staging |
| **Performance Tests** | Load, stress, scalability | Yes | Must meet NFRs before Prod |
| **Accessibility Tests** | WCAG 2.2 AA | Partial | Must pass before Prod |
| **Security Tests** | SAST, SCA, DAST, pen-test | Partial | No high/critical before Prod |

**Test Data:**
- Use synthetic or anonymized data in non-production
- Never use production data without approval and de-identification

### 4.7 CI/CD and Quality Gates

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Validate:** Lint, format, license compliance, SAST, SCA
2. **Build:** Compile, unit tests, package, SBOM generation
3. **Test:** Contract, integration, E2E, accessibility, performance
4. **Security:** DAST, container scan, IaC scan
5. **Deploy:** Ephemeral env for PRs; staging with smoke tests; production canary/blue-green
6. **Observe:** Post-deploy checks; error budgets; auto-rollback if SLOs violated

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests pass
- Code coverage >= threshold
- No high/critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance meets NFR targets
- Accessibility score >= WCAG 2.2 AA
- Deployment automation validated

### 4.8 Observability and Reliability

**Innovation:**
- Proposals follow lightweight RFC process
- Pilots timeboxed with success criteria

### 4.11 Compliance and Audit

**Automated Compliance:**

- Maintain SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials)

**Standards Alignment:**
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Security)
- ISO/IEC 12207 (SDLC)
